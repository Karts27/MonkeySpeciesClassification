# MonkeySpeciesClassification

The dataset consists of two files, training and validation. Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form Wikipedia's monkey cladogram. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images). Images were downloaded with help of the googliser open source code.

This dataset is intended as a test case for fine-grain classification tasks, perhaps best used in combination with transfer learning.
